"""Constants for the Eufy NVR (local) integration.

Cameras are auto-discovered from a go2rtc instance that the bridge/add-on runs.
The integration never talks to the eufy cloud or the NVR directly — it only reads
go2rtc's REST API to learn which ``eufy_*`` streams exist, then exposes each as a
Home Assistant camera that pulls ``rtsp://<host>:<rtsp_port>/<stream>``.
