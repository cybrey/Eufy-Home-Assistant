"""Eufy NVR (local) — auto-discovering camera integration.

The heavy lifting (reversed-WebRTC -> RTSP) is done by the bridge/add-on, which
runs a go2rtc instance. This integration is a thin, local-polling client: it asks
go2rtc which ``eufy_*`` streams exist and exposes each as a Home Assistant camera,
grouped under a single "Eufy NVR" device. New cameras appear automatically as the
bridge publishes them — there is nothing to configure per camera.
