# Changelog

## 0.7.28

- Add-on: dual-lens cameras (S4 PoE) now also publish their fixed wide lens as `<camera>_wide`, which the
  companion shows as a separate "... Wide" camera. The existing stream (the PTZ lens) is unchanged. Adding a
  camera to exclude_streams hides both lenses; add `<camera>_wide` to hide only the wide lens.

## 0.7.27

- Integration: new option "Preview refresh interval" (Settings > Devices & services > Eufy NVR > Configure).
  Dashboard previews refresh every 2 minutes by default (was a fixed 15 minutes); range 30 s to 15 min.
  No add-on code changes.

## 0.7.26

- Add-on: stop discarding the opening keyframe. ffmpeg ran with `-fflags nobuffer`, which drops the packets it
  probes, so snapshots and the start of live view were grey with speckles until the next NVR keyframe.

## 0.7.25

- Integration: the snapshot primer runs as a background task. It loops forever, and as a normal task it held
  Home Assistant's startup until the ~6-minute bootstrap timeout (and blocked add-on updates meanwhile).
  No add-on code changes.

## 0.7.24

- Add-on: load go2rtc's `ws` module. 0.7.23 allowed /api/ws but the module that serves it was not loaded, so
  live view still failed with "does not allow WebRTC signaling". Update the add-on; the companion only changes
  its error text.

## 0.7.23

- Add-on: go2rtc now allows /api/ws, which the companion uses for WebRTC signaling. Without it 0.7.22 live view
  failed with "cannot open the Eufy go2rtc WebSocket (WSServerHandshakeError)". Update both the add-on and the
  companion.

## 0.7.22

- Integration: camera live view now uses WebRTC straight from the add-on's go2rtc. Home Assistant no longer
  offers HLS for these cameras; its HLS worker kept the stream open after the viewer closed, holding the NVR's
  single live session so the next camera waited up to 90 s. Closing a view now frees the NVR immediately.
  No add-on code changes.

## 0.7.21

- Timestamp video on arrival instead of assuming 25 fps. The NVR sends ~10 fps, so stream time ran at 0.4x real
  time and Home Assistant's live player stalled on a grey first frame.

## 0.7.20

- Integration: dashboard thumbnails are cached for 15 minutes (was 30 seconds) and a failed capture waits 60 s
  before retrying (was 0.5 s). Each refresh opened the NVR's single live session, so a dashboard of camera
  cards kept preempting the camera being watched and live view never settled. No add-on code changes.

## 0.7.19

- New `exclude_streams` option: comma-separated stream names (e.g. `eufy_front_door`) left out of go2rtc, so a
  camera that never yields video stops holding the NVR's single live session on every snapshot attempt.
- Integration: reloading no longer fails with `failed_unload` (upstream #14).

## 0.7.18

- Anchor action3 signaling to channel 0 (upstream PR #18, fixes #17). On newer T8N00 firmware, cameras on
  channels 1+ connected but the NVR ignored their commands (`ptcs_in=0`) and no video arrived.

## 0.7.17

- Verify the NVR's DTLS certificate fingerprint over its raw DER bytes instead of parsing it with `cryptography`.
  Firmware whose certificate carries extra signature-algorithm parameters was rejected with
  `ParseError { kind: ExtraData ... signature_alg }`, so the peer never connected and discovery failed.

## 0.7.16

- Validate the persisted account-bound token against `ws/sign` before logging in. Container restarts and periodic
  checks now reuse a live token instead of creating another passport session, avoiding Eufy's daily login cap.
- Refuse to start producer retry storms when both the cached token and fresh login are rejected. Periodic renewal
  happens only after the live validation fails.

## 0.7.15

- Default T8N00 signaling to native `call` and parse/send full SDP offers and answers. Live probes against
  an online NVR with four online cameras showed compact `scall` remaining at status 100 before status 408,
  while native `call` reached status 200 in 1.9 seconds and delivered its SDP offer in 2.6 seconds.
- Keep explicit `scall` support for diagnostics and correct the WebSocket subprotocol region so it follows
  the selected smart-service region rather than the account country.

## 0.7.14

- Update the reversed NVR signaling envelope to match Eufy's current official web client. Action messages now
  use `MD5(channel + admin_user_id + timestamp)` as the account proof, carry the actual camera channel, prefix
  request IDs with the authenticated session token, and acknowledge scall status 200 immediately. The old random
  proof/channel-0 envelope was accepted by the signaling WebSocket but could leave the NVR indefinitely at TURN
  status 100 without an SDP offer.

## 0.7.13

- Align Home Assistant's initial snapshot request with the complete supervised Eufy retry window. The primer no
  longer cancels after nine seconds and immediately queues another producer while go2rtc is still waiting for the
  NVR. A 95-second per-camera ceiling and 180-second aggregate setup budget allow recovery without blocking HA
  indefinitely during an Eufy signaling outage.
- Extend go2rtc's producer startup ceiling to 90 seconds so time spent waiting for the NVR's one-session gate does
  not consume the retry attempt before signaling begins.
- Reject graceful child exit as discovery success when the supervisor itself ended a stalled TURN session. A
  cached `cameras.json` can no longer hide a failed fresh discovery.

## 0.7.12

- Prime every camera's bounded fallback image before Home Assistant exposes the camera entities. This removes
  the startup race where dashboard requests could consume Home Assistant's ten-second proxy deadline while the
  NVR was still rotating its single hardware session through the sequential primer.
- Exclude go2rtc's `keyframe`, `jpeg`, and `mjpeg` snapshot consumers from the adaptive live-view lease. A Home
  Assistant thumbnail refresh now releases the Eufy session promptly instead of looking like a live viewer and
  retaining the camera for another 30 seconds.

## 0.7.11

- Add a direct cross-process preemption hint from a queued Eufy producer to the adaptive warm controller.
  go2rtc does not expose a waiting consumer until its producer starts, so API-only observation could not see a
  different camera blocked behind the retained session. The session gate now evicts that warm lease immediately,
  while same-camera reopens still reuse the existing producer without spawning a waiter.

## 0.7.10

- Preserve the post-`closeLive` appliance teardown grace during normal go2rtc camera handoffs. The graceful
  signal correctly closed the Eufy session in 0.7.9, but its stop event also skipped the final one-second lock
  hold, allowing the next queued camera to race the NVR's internal retirement and receive status `486`.

## 0.7.9

- Configure go2rtc to stop the Eufy supervisor with `SIGINT` and allow a five-second graceful ceiling.
  Its default `exec.CommandContext` cancellation killed the wrapper immediately, bypassing `closeLive` and
  leaving an orphan child WebRTC session that made later cameras receive signaling status `486`.
- Wait for the NVR's status-0 `closeLive` acknowledgement before closing WebRTC, with a bounded fallback if
  the acknowledgement is lost.
- Serve seeded thumbnails stale-while-revalidate: expired dashboard images return immediately while one
  serialized background refresh updates them. First-ever camera seeds receive a 30-second aggregate window
  so a four-camera cold burst completes under the NVR's one-camera hardware limit instead of partially 500ing.

## 0.7.8

- Send `closeLive` after discovery sessions as well as video sessions. The NVR counts the discovery
  WebRTC control connection against the same one-session limit, so merely closing the peer connection
  could make every later producer receive signaling status `486` despite no active local consumer.
- Retry only cameras that still lack a primed snapshot, using bounded exponential backoff. A partial
  startup cycle no longer waits 30 minutes before trying the missing camera fallbacks again or repeats
  successful camera work during the retry window.

## 0.7.7

- Send Eufy's `closeLive` command (`cmd 1004`) over the active SCTP/WebRTC control channel before
  stopping a producer. Previous releases killed the process tree without telling the appliance to
  retire the live session, which could leave every subsequent camera request returning status `486`.
- Make supervised shutdown graceful-first: interrupt only the Python protocol engine while keeping
  its framing oracle and media child alive long enough to transmit `closeLive`, then force-clean the
  complete process group if it does not exit within the bounded grace period.

## 0.7.6

- Reduce go2rtc's idle producer kill delay from eight seconds to one. The adaptive warmer already
  owns intentional reuse, so the old delay only consumed almost all of Home Assistant's nine-second
  snapshot deadline when handing the NVR's single session to another camera.
- Keep the cross-process Eufy session gate locked for a separate one-second appliance teardown grace
  period. This prevents the next producer from racing the NVR's internal WebRTC cleanup and receiving
  signaling status `486`.
- Add credential-free adaptive-controller startup/API diagnostics for live deployment verification.

## 0.7.5

- Prime one snapshot per camera sequentially after Home Assistant loads the integration, then refresh
  the fallback set only every 30 minutes. A shared one-hour stale cache lets a first-time multi-camera
  dashboard return known images while the NVR services cold producers one at a time, instead of timing
  out later camera requests.
- Share snapshot coalescing across all camera entities and retain per-camera eviction, preserving the
  NVR's one-session invariant without coupling unrelated camera lifecycles.

## 0.7.4

- Serialize access to the NVR's single live WebRTC session across every camera producer and classify
  signaling status `486` immediately, eliminating the 25-second timeout/retry cascades caused by
  concurrent Home Assistant dashboard requests.
- Replace the permanent per-camera `keep_warm` processes with an Eufy-specific adaptive session
  controller. It holds only the most recently viewed camera for 30 seconds by default, hands the
  session to a newly requested camera, and carries credentials only in authenticated HTTP headers.
- Serve snapshots through go2rtc's authenticated, coalescing JPEG endpoint instead of launching a
  second Home Assistant FFmpeg process. Cache a fresh frame for 30 seconds and use a bounded stale
  frame during transient camera handoffs so dashboards reopen immediately.
- Start cloud signing and the SCTP framing runtime in parallel, disable debug-frame disk writes unless
  explicitly requested, and reduce per-frame hot-path logging while retaining five-second progress
  markers for stall detection.
- Change the container health check to an authentication-independent TCP probe so enabling required
  go2rtc credentials cannot make a healthy add-on appear unhealthy.

## 0.7.3

- Make the Dockerfile self-contained with a pinned multi-architecture Debian base image. Current Home
  Assistant Supervisor versions reject digest references in the deprecated `build.yaml` schema and
  otherwise fall back to Alpine, where the Debian `apt-get` build fails.
- Remove the deprecated build file and make CI exercise the same Dockerfile default used by Supervisor.

## 0.7.2

- Implement the current official web mailbox/device-verification flow for `fa_info.step=26052`: request
  the email code through the push service and repeat the encrypted passport login with the provisional
  token and six-digit `verification_code` (GitHub issue #13).
- Bind every auth cache to a non-plaintext account/region/country fingerprint. A failed login now refuses
  legacy, malformed, or different-account caches instead of feeding a previous user's token to the NVR.
- Require local go2rtc credentials and apply them to both the management API/UI and RTSP server. The HACS
  integration supplies Basic auth, emits credentialed RTSP URLs internally, and omits the secret from logs,
  state attributes, configuration URLs, and diagnostics.
- Reap the complete engine process group on cancellation or leader exit, add a post-SDP connection timeout,
  trust the oracle's decoded `-104` marker instead of a byte-length heuristic, and fail producers when
  ffmpeg exits or its pipe breaks.
- Pin Python runtime dependencies, CI tools, GitHub Actions, the Home Assistant base images, the bridge
  source commit, and go2rtc version. Verify
  SHA-256 for go2rtc and all downloaded Eufy worker assets; remove the mutable unverified FFmpeg download.
- Run CI against the real runtime dependency set on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, including import smoke tests.
- Upgrade `idna` to 3.15, the first patched release for CVE-2026-45409.

## 0.7.1

- Add `eufy_run.py`, a process supervisor around the reversed WebRTC engine. It opens fresh signaling
  sessions when scall/TURN stalls without an SDP offer, retries a producer that never reaches its first
  video frame, and restarts a stream that stops producing frames while go2rtc itself remains healthy.
- Own the complete oracle/ffmpeg/engine process group so failed or stalled sessions are terminated as a
  unit before retry, preventing abandoned camera producers from accumulating.
- Route generated go2rtc producers and add-on discovery through the supervisor while retaining go2rtc's
  60-second startup allowance and bounded kill timeout.
- Detect the fixed 148-byte non-JSON command-rejection shape reported by shared/member accounts during
  discovery and emit an explicit owner/admin-account diagnostic instead of retrying a permission failure.
- Add offline regression coverage for signaling state, video progress/stall markers, authorization
  classification, and supervised producer generation.

## 0.7.0

- Harden discovery/config generation with persistent collision-safe stream identities, strict manifest and
  registry validation, atomic writes, and valid empty configuration when all cameras are offline.
- Harden the Home Assistant integration with safer host/port validation, IPv6-safe URLs, duplicate endpoint
  detection, corrected reconfiguration identity, removal of the redundant double-reload listener, and
  coalesced/timeout-bounded snapshots.
- Upgrade go2rtc from `v1.9.9` to `v1.9.14` and configure a 60-second exec `starttimeout` plus bounded process
  termination for slow Eufy WebRTC cold starts. This directly addresses the premature `exec: timeout` path
  reported in issue #5, while keeping the issue open until physical NVR validation confirms the full live path.
- Document that the configured eufy account must own/administer the NVR; shared/member accounts can authenticate
  but may receive fixed `-104` command rejections (issue #8).
- Keep issue #6 open: `scall/turn status 100` without a later status 200 / SDP offer is a separate signalling
  failure and is not safe to claim fixed without device-side validation.
- Make development add-on builds use an existing source ref rather than depending on a release tag before it exists.

## 0.6.9

- Update eufy's required SCTP framing runtime from the removed `0_0_2` CDN assets to the current
  `0_0_4` files used by the web client. Build-time and startup checks now require the matching JS/WASM
  assets so an image cannot ship with a stale framing runtime.

## 0.6.8

- Persist the discovered camera manifest under `/data` (new `EUFY_CAMERAS` override, mirroring
  `EUFY_AUTH`) so `eufy_stream.py --discover` and `gen_go2rtc.py` always agree on its location and
  the list survives a container restart/rebuild.
- Make `eufy_stream.py --discover` exit non-zero when it never received a camera list, instead of
  reporting "Discovery OK" and letting `gen_go2rtc.py` crash with `FileNotFoundError` on the missing
  `cameras.json`. Write the manifest atomically.
- When discovery keeps failing, regenerate `go2rtc.yaml` from the last persisted camera list before
  falling back to the previous `go2rtc.yaml`.

## 0.6.7

- Refresh the eufy auth session periodically even when `keep_warm` is disabled, and replace the auth
  file atomically, so on-demand camera streams continue working after the original token expires.
- Stop logging the `ws/sign` response body or token prefix, and report expired/rejected sessions with
  an actionable error instead of an internal `KeyError`.

## 0.6.6

- Start the video stream shortly after the NVR acknowledges `openLive` instead of waiting a fixed
  second, leaving enough time for Home Assistant to decode the first JPEG within its request limit.

## 0.6.5

- Skip ffmpeg's unnecessary input analysis for the known raw HEVC camera feed. This removes several
  seconds from a cold stream launch so Home Assistant can receive a still before its fixed 10-second
  camera-image timeout.

## 0.6.4

- When `homeassistant.local` is unreachable from the Home Assistant Core container, retry the
  configured internal URL's LAN host automatically. This keeps the friendly default while avoiding
  mDNS failures inside HAOS containers.

## 0.6.3

- Preserve line boundaries when parsing discovered stream names for `keep_warm`, so each camera gets
  its own warmer instead of all stream slugs being concatenated into one invalid RTSP path.

## 0.6.2

- Update eufy's required SCTP framing runtime from removed `0_0_1` CDN assets to the current
  `0_0_2` files used by the web client.
- Fail the add-on image build when those runtime-critical files cannot be downloaded, and run the
  offline SCTP round-trip self-test during the build so a broken image cannot be installed again.

## 0.6.1

- Move the add-on's go2rtc to dedicated host-network ports: API `1985`, RTSP `8556`, and WebRTC
  `8557`. Home Assistant's built-in go2rtc already owns API `1984` on HAOS, so v0.6.0 could connect
  the companion integration to the wrong server and report that no `eufy_*` cameras existed.
- Detect a reachable go2rtc containing only non-Eufy streams and report it as the wrong instance,
  with the dedicated Eufy API port in the corrective message.

## 0.6.0

- Fix discovery and streaming for EU and IE accounts by routing `ws/sign` and the signaling WebSocket
  through the selected region's smart-service host. Headless and browser-captured auth files now persist
  the signaling region so manual bridge commands work without re-exporting `EUFY_REGION`.
- Rebuild the companion integration around a shared go2rtc client, with normalized IPv4/IPv6 endpoints,
  a distinct "bridge reachable but no Eufy streams" setup error, live producer/consumer attributes, and
  privacy-safe downloadable diagnostics.
- Persist `auth.json`, camera discovery, and generated go2rtc configuration under the add-on `/data`
  directory. A transient login or discovery outage can reuse the last working local configuration.
- Start the add-on automatically after a host reboot and remove unused Supervisor/Home Assistant API
  permissions.
- Pin the bridge source used by the add-on image to the matching `v0.6.0` release instead of mutable `main`.

## 0.5.2

- **More login regions + a separate account country.** The `region` option now offers
  US | EU | IE (the eufy *server* your account lives on), and a new optional `country` field
  lets accounts registered outside those regions — e.g. AU — authenticate against the nearest
  server while still identifying their real country. Leave `country` blank to use the region.
- Removed a hard-coded device-serial fallback from the bridge; it now relies on auto-discovery
  or the optional `station_sn` override.

## 0.5.1

- **Offline cameras no longer create dead "no feed" entities.** Discovery used to publish an
  offline channel as a normal stream (the "offline" note was an inert comment), so the HA
  integration made a green entity that 404'd on open. `gen_go2rtc.py` now skips status-0
  cameras entirely; they're re-added automatically the next time discovery sees them online.
- **Faster live-view open.** Shortened the transcode GOP from 25 to 12 frames. The feed runs
  below 25 fps, so a keyframe now arrives every ~0.5-0.8s instead of ~1.5-2s, cutting the
  per-open keyframe wait (on top of `keep_warm`, which removes the producer cold start).

## 0.5.0

- **Live view now actually plays.** The bridge transcodes the NVR's HEVC to **H.264**
  (libx264 ultrafast/zerolatency, ~1s GOP) before publishing, so Home Assistant's browser
  live view renders it. Previously the stream was raw H.265 (`-c:v copy`), which most
  browsers can't play live — you'd get the snapshot thumbnail but "enlarge" never loaded.
  This is the headline fix and is always on.
- **Optional low-latency "keep-warm"** (`keep_warm`, default **off**). Holds each online
  camera warm so opening live view is near-instant instead of waiting 5-13s for the WebRTC
  cold start. It's **off by default** because it runs one continuous H.264 software encode
  per online camera — only enable it on a host with CPU headroom (3-4 always-on encodes can
  saturate a low-power Pi). The NVR itself streams all channels concurrently, so the NVR side
  is fine; the cost is host CPU. Pair with `video_copy` for a cheap always-on warm.
- **`video_copy` option** (default off). Publishes raw H.265 instead of transcoding — lower
  CPU, but the live view is thumbnail-only. Replaces the undocumented `EUFY_VIDEO_COPY` env.
- **Periodic re-login** (`token_refresh_hours`, default 6) refreshes `auth.json` so a warm
  stream that drops can reconnect past the ~1-day eufy session-token lifetime.

## 0.4.1

- Fix: headless discovery (`--discover`) now exits when it completes, so the add-on
  reliably moves on to start go2rtc instead of hanging (previously it could loop on
  `STATS … video=0` and never start the streams).

## 0.4.0

- Headless **email/password login** — no more one-time token paste. On start the add-on
  logs into the eufy passport, derives your NVR's `station_sn`, and writes `auth.json`.
- Auto-discovers the NVR + cameras (cmd 9100) and serves each channel as RTSP/WebRTC via
  a bundled, pinned go2rtc.
- Add-on relocated to the repo root and `webui`/`watchdog` use the `[PORT:1984]`
  placeholder so the Supervisor store lists it correctly.
