Pull a **local, LAN-direct live video stream** from a **eufy PoE NVR (S4 Max / model `T8N00`)** and its PoE
cameras into **Home Assistant** — as a standard RTSP/WebRTC stream you can drop straight onto a dashboard.

No eufy cloud relay for the video. No Frigate. No flashing the cameras. Just Home Assistant's built-in
**go2rtc** and a small bridge that speaks the NVR's (previously undocumented) WebRTC protocol.

> **The physical NVR remains part of this design.** The PoE cameras use an encrypted proprietary link to
> the NVR and do not expose usable RTSP/ONVIF endpoints themselves. This project makes the NVR-delivered
> camera feeds locally accessible; it does not replace or reflash the NVR.

> ⚠️ This is independent interoperability/reverse-engineering work for use with **your own** hardware. It is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by Anker/eufy. Use it on devices you own.

## TL;DR — two ways to run it

**The easy way (Home Assistant OS):** install the **add-on**, enter your eufy account and a separate local
go2rtc password. The add-on runs the whole engine on your HA host and serves the cameras as RTSP/WebRTC. Add the companion
**integration** and the camera entities appear automatically.

**The manual way (any HA, or a separate PC):** run the **bridge** yourself on a LAN machine with Python + Node
+ ffmpeg, and point HA at its RTSP URLs.

```
eufy NVR  ──WebRTC (DTLS/SCTP, LAN-direct)──►  bridge / add-on  ──RTSP──►  Home Assistant (go2rtc)
192.168.1.152                                  Python + Node + ffmpeg + go2rtc          dashboard / cameras
```

Live 1080p H.265, ~15–25 fps, pulled **directly over your LAN** — the only thing that touches eufy's cloud is the
login/signaling handshake; the pixels never leave your network. Streams are named `eufy_<camera>` (e.g.
`eufy_garage`, `eufy_front_gate`).

---

## Why this exists — what we found

The eufy S4 generation was widely assumed to use the classic eufy/ThroughTek **P2P** transport (the AES-128-ECB
"start livestream" path that [bropat/eufy-security-client](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client) and the
[fuatakgun/eufy-security](https://github.com/fuatakgun/eufy-security) HACS integration implement). **It doesn't.**

We captured the official web client (`security.eufy.com` / `nvr.eufy.com`) and reversed the protocol. The findings:

1. **It's WebRTC, not P2P.** The NVR's cloud provisioning has empty `p2p_conn`/`app_conn` and instead lists
   `signaling_servers` + `webrtc_sdk_version`. bropat/eufy-security-client has **no** WebRTC support, which is
   exactly why this NVR is "experimental"/non-working there.
2. **Signaling is cloud, media is local.** A small JSON handshake over a cloud WebSocket
   (`security-smart.eufylife.com`) exchanges SDP/ICE. The winning ICE pair is your host ↔ the NVR's LAN IP
   (`192.168.1.152 typ host`) — **media flows LAN-direct over DTLS/SCTP**, not through eufy's TURN relay.
3. **There is an extra framing layer.** The 6 WebRTC DataChannels carry an *inner* eufy reliable transport
   (magic `"PTCS"`, with FEC + retransmission) implemented in a WebAssembly module (`libsctp`,
   `sctp_frame_manager_web.c`). App messages are wrapped in a 16-byte `XZYH` header and fragmented into PTCS
   packets. We run eufy's **exact WASM** as a framing oracle (in Node) so we don't have to reimplement FEC.
4. **`openLive` is a red herring; `startStream` is the trigger.** The command that *returns camera params*
   (`cmd 1103`) does **not** start video. Live video only begins after a separate **`startStream` command
   (`cmd 1003`)** with a `chn_list` payload. This single fact was the whole ballgame.
5. **Video = H.265.** Each video DataChannel message is `[16-byte XZYH header][22-byte media header][Annex-B
   HEVC NAL]`. Strip 38 bytes → a clean H.265 elementary stream (VPS/SPS/PPS/IDR + P-frames, 1080p).
6. **Headless login is ECDH, not RSA.** The web "passport" login encrypts the password with ECDH(P-256)+AES-256-CBC
   and rides an encrypted, HMAC-signed request wrapper keyed on the *openapi* key/exchange (`gtoken = MD5(user_id)`).
   Reversing this is what makes "type email + password → done" possible. See [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## Architecture

The heavy lifting (WebRTC + DTLS + the libsctp WASM + H.265 extraction) needs Python, Node and ffmpeg. It runs
either **as a HA add-on** (a container on Home Assistant OS) or **as the bridge** on any LAN machine. Either way it
exposes plain RTSP via a local **go2rtc**; Home Assistant simply pulls it.

```
                         ┌──────────── add-on (on HAOS) │ or bridge host (a PC/NUC on the LAN) ────────────┐
 eufy NVR  WebRTC        │  eufy_stream.py (aiortc)  ──►  sctp_oracle.js (eufy libsctp WASM, Node)         │

                         │     ffmpeg ──►  go2rtc ──►  rtsp://<host>:<rtsp-port>/eufy_<camera>              │
                         └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                                       │ RTSP pull (LAN)
                                                       ▼
                              Home Assistant (built-in go2rtc)  ──►  WebRTC/HLS on your dashboard
```

**On-demand:** go2rtc only spawns the engine while something is actually watching, so the NVR's single live
session isn't held 24/7 (important — the NVR allows one active stream at a time). An Eufy-specific session
controller serializes competing camera requests and retains only the most recently viewed producer for a
short adaptive lease; go2rtc remains the standards-compliant RTSP/WebRTC and cached-JPEG transport.

## Install — Option A: Home Assistant add-on (recommended)

Runs everything on your HA host; no always-on PC and no token paste.

1. **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ (top-right) → Repositories** → add
   `https://github.com/HallyAus/Eufy-Home-Assistant` → **Add**, then close.
2. Find and install **Eufy NVR Local Server**. (First build is slow — it compiles/links the WebRTC stack
   and downloads go2rtc.)
3. **Configuration** tab → enter your eufy account:
   - `email` / `password` — your eufy login
   - `region` — `US`, `EU`, or `IE` (the eufy server region that holds your account)
   - `signaling_mode` — keep the default `call`; deployed T8N00 firmware can time out `scall`
   - `log_level` — `info` (raise to `debug` only when troubleshooting)
   - `go2rtc_username` / `go2rtc_password` — local credentials (password: at least 16 characters) that
     protect the camera API, web UI, and RTSP streams; enter the same values in the companion integration
   - `adaptive_warm_seconds` — how long to retain the last-viewed camera after it closes (default `30`;
     another camera preempts it immediately; set `0` to disable)
   - *(optional)* `station_sn` — only if auto-discovery can't find your NVR's serial
   - *(optional)* `captcha_id` + `captcha_answer` — only if a login is challenged (the log prints the `captcha_id`)
   - *(optional)* `verification_code` — when the log says mailbox verification is required, enter the
     six-digit code Eufy emailed and restart; the first challenged start requests the code automatically
4. **Start** the add-on and watch the **Log** tab. It logs in, discovers your cameras, generates the stream list,
   and starts go2rtc. Click **Open Web UI** (the Eufy go2rtc on port `1985`) to test the streams.

Your eufy password and verification code are passed only via the environment, scrubbed after login, and
never printed to the log. Cached auth is cryptographically bound to the configured account/region/country,
so a failed login cannot silently reuse another account's token.

Then add the **companion integration** (below) to get camera entities — for the add-on use your **HA host's
LAN IP**, not `127.0.0.1`.

Upgrading from an older release: set the new local credentials in the add-on first. Home Assistant will then
open a reauthentication prompt for the existing companion-integration entry; enter those same credentials.

---

## Install — Option B: manual bridge (any HA, or a separate PC)

For a non-HAOS Home Assistant, or to run the engine on a different always-on machine.

**Requirements (bridge host, Windows or Linux, same LAN as the NVR):**
- **Python 3.11+** with `aiortc av websockets aiohttp pycryptodome cryptography` (`bridge/requirements.txt`)
- **Node 18+** (runs the libsctp WASM oracle)
- **ffmpeg** installed from a trusted package source; `bridge/fetch_deps.js` downloads checksum-verified
  go2rtc and eufy WASM assets
- A **eufy account** that owns the NVR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HallyAus/Eufy-Home-Assistant
cd Eufy-Home-Assistant/bridge

pip install -r requirements.txt        # Python deps
node fetch_deps.js                     # downloads verified go2rtc + eufy libsctp WASM

# Auth — pick ONE:
#  (a) headless email/password login -> writes auth.json (gitignored):
EUFY_EMAIL="you@example.com" EUFY_PASSWORD="••••••" EUFY_REGION="US" python auth_login.py
#  (b) or the browser token method:
node get_auth.js                       # log into the eufy web portal -> auth.json

# Auto-discover the NVR IP + cameras, then generate friendly stream names:
python eufy_stream.py --discover       # writes cameras.json
GO2RTC_USERNAME="eufy" GO2RTC_PASSWORD="a-long-local-password" python gen_go2rtc.py <BRIDGE_IP>
```

Start it (`start_bridge.cmd` on Windows, `./start_bridge.sh` on Linux) and verify with any RTSP player:

```bash
ffplay rtsp://eufy:a-long-local-password@127.0.0.1:8554/eufy_garage
```

## Get the cameras into Home Assistant

Use whichever you like — both ride HA's built-in go2rtc/camera stack.

### Companion integration (recommended) — auto-creates one camera per stream

The integration polls the engine's go2rtc and creates a camera entity for every `eufy_*` stream automatically —
**no stream names to type, no per-camera config.** New cameras appear on their own.

> Prerequisite: [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed.

1. **HACS → ⋮ → Custom repositories** → Repository `https://github.com/HallyAus/Eufy-Home-Assistant`,
   Category **Integration** → **Add**. (Or use the button below.)

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=HallyAus&repository=Eufy-Home-Assistant&category=integration)

2. In HACS search **"Eufy NVR Local Companion"** → **Download** → **Restart Home Assistant**.
3. **Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration →** search **"Eufy NVR Local Companion"**, then enter:
   - **Host** — where go2rtc runs. For the **add-on** (Option A) use your **HA host's LAN IP**
     (e.g. `192.168.1.177`) — **not** `127.0.0.1`: the integration runs inside HA Core and can't reach a
     `host_network` add-on over localhost, and HA's own built-in go2rtc already occupies `127.0.0.1:1984`.
     For the **bridge** (Option B) use the **bridge machine's IP** (e.g. `192.168.1.7`).
   - **Add-on:** API port `1985` &nbsp;•&nbsp; RTSP port `8556`
   - **Manual bridge defaults:** API port `1984` &nbsp;•&nbsp; RTSP port `8554`
   - **Local username/password:** the same `GO2RTC_USERNAME` / `GO2RTC_PASSWORD` configured in the add-on
     or used when generating the manual bridge configuration

   It auto-creates a `camera.eufy_nvr_*` entity per discovered stream, grouped under one "Eufy NVR" device.

   [![Add the Eufy NVR integration to your Home Assistant instance.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=eufy_nvr)

### Or the Generic Camera integration (no HACS)

**Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Generic Camera** → Stream Source
`rtsp://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/eufy_garage` (one per camera; URL-encode special characters in
the credentials; use port `8556` for the add-on or `8554` for the manual bridge; `<host>` is your **HA host's
LAN IP** for the add-on, or the bridge IP).
Or paste the streams into HA's own `/config/go2rtc.yaml` and reference them from a `camera:` / WebRTC card.

## "I'm not a fan of Frigate" — you don't need it

The engine emits **standard RTSP / H.265**, so any of these work with zero extra infrastructure:

- **Home Assistant native (recommended):** built-in **go2rtc** gives you sub-second WebRTC live view on
  dashboards — no add-ons, no NVR software.
- **HA Generic Camera** integration (RTSP) for a simple camera entity.
- **Recording / events (only if you want them):** [Scrypted](https://github.com/koush/scrypted),
  [Blue Iris](https://blueirissoftware.com/), [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx), or go2rtc
  itself. Frigate is *one* option, not a requirement.
- **Anything that speaks RTSP** (VLC, ffmpeg, a browser via go2rtc's WebRTC).

---

## Status & roadmap

**v0.7.16:** eliminates concurrent-session startup storms with an Eufy-specific one-session gate and adaptive
last-viewed-camera lease. Home Assistant snapshots use go2rtc's coalesced JPEG endpoint directly; a sequential
primer seeds every camera before its entities are exposed, then stale-while-revalidate makes multi-camera dashboards return immediately while
cold producers refresh in the background. go2rtc now signals the Eufy supervisor gracefully and allows it to wait
for the NVR's `closeLive` acknowledgement before WebRTC teardown, then holds the session gate through the
appliance's retirement grace. This prevents both ghost sessions and next-camera races that return `486 busy`.
Queued producers also signal the adaptive controller directly, closing go2rtc's visibility gap and preempting a
different camera's warm lease before the new producer enters signaling. Snapshot-only go2rtc consumers are
excluded from live-view leases so a thumbnail cannot delay the next camera for 30 seconds. Initial snapshot and
producer deadlines now cover the complete supervised Eufy retry window without permitting an unbounded HA setup.
The signaling envelope also tracks Eufy's current official web client, including its channel-bound administrator
proof and immediate status-200 acknowledgement.

**v0.6.0:** a rebuilt companion integration with stricter endpoint validation, actionable empty-stream
setup errors, stream activity attributes, privacy-safe diagnostics, persistent add-on state, automatic startup,
and reproducible version-pinned add-on builds. It also includes region-aware signaling for US/EU/IE accounts.

**Released (v0.5.2):** LAN-direct connect, `startStream`, libsctp reassembly, H.265 extraction, sustained
~18–25 fps 1080p, served as RTSP via go2rtc, with **auto-discovery** of the NVR + cameras (channels 0–3),
**headless email/password login**, a **HA add-on**, and a **companion auto-discovery integration**.

- [x] **Engine** — WebRTC → H.265 → RTSP/go2rtc (proven).
- [x] **Auto-discovery** — NVR IP + cameras + channels via cmd 9100.
- [x] **Headless email/password login** — reversed ECDH/AES passport login; no browser token needed.
- [x] **Companion HACS integration** — auto-creates the camera entities from go2rtc (zero manual entry).
- [~] **HA add-on container** — bundles Python+Node+ffmpeg+go2rtc and runs on HAOS (shipped; the engine/login are
      validated — pending broad on-HAOS build testing across architectures).
- [ ] Audio (`1301`) / two-way talk; auto-reconnect hardening; per-camera quality (`streamtype`).

## Notes / limits

- The NVR allows **one** active live session. The add-on serializes its own camera producers, but the official
  eufy app can still occupy that hardware session; the add-on reports `486 busy` immediately when it does.
- A passport login bumps the signed-in app session, so avoid logging into the eufy mobile app at the same moment
  the add-on/bridge is logging in or discovering.
- The login/signaling uses eufy's cloud; the **video itself is LAN-local**.
- Your eufy credentials, local go2rtc password, and session tokens are **gitignored/private state** — never
  commit or paste them into issue logs.
